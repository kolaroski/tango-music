    <p>The exact origins of tango—both the dance and the word itself—are lost in myth and an unrecorded history. The generally accepted theory is that in the mid-1800s, African slaves were brought to Argentina and began to influence the local culture. The word "tango" may be straightforwardly African in origin, meaning "closed place" or "reserved ground." Or it may derive from Portuguese (and from the Latin verb tanguere, to touch) and was picked up by Africans on the slave ships. Whatever its origin, the word "tango" acquired the standard meaning of the place where African slaves and free blacks gathered to dance.</p>
     <p> Argentina was undergoing a massive immigration during the later part of the 1800s and early 1900s. In 1869, Buenos Aires had a population of 180,000. By 1914, its population was 1.5 million. The intermixing of African, Spanish, Italian, British, Polish, Russian and native-born Argentines resulted in a melting pot of cultures, and each borrowed dance and music from one another. Traditional polkas, waltzes and mazurkas were mixed with the popular habanera from Cuba and the candombe rhythms from Africa.</p>
      
      <p>Most immigrants were single men hoping to earn their fortunes in this newly expanding country. They were typically poor and desperate, hoping to make enough money to return to Europe or bring their families to Argentina. The evolution of tango reflects their profound sense of loss and longing for the people and places they left behind.</p>
      
      <p>Most likely the tango was born in African-Argentine dance venues attended by compadritos, young men, mostly native born and poor, who liked to dress in slouch hats, loosely tied neckerchiefs and high-heeled boots with knives tucked casually into their belts. The compadritos took the tango back to the Corrales Viejos—the slaughterhouse district of Buenos Aires—and introduced it in various low-life establishments where dancing took place: bars, dance halls and brothels. It was here that the African rhythms met the Argentine milonga music (a fast-paced polka) and soon new steps were invented and took hold.</p>
      
      <p>Although high society looked down upon the activities in the barrios, well-heeled sons of the porteño oligarchy were not averse to slumming. Eventually, everyone found out about the tango and, by the beginning of the twentieth century, the tango as both a dance and as an embryonic form of popular music had established a firm foothold in the fast-expanding city of its birth. It soon spread to provincial towns of Argentina and across the River Plate to Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, where it became as much a part of the urban culture as in Buenos Aires.</p>
      
      <p>The worldwide spread of the tango came in the early 1900s when wealthy sons of Argentine society families made their way to Paris and introduced the tango into a society eager for innovation and not entirely averse to the risqué nature of the dance or dancing with young, wealthy Latin men. By 1913, the tango had become an international phenomenon in Paris, London and New York. There were tango teas, tango train excursions and even tango colors—most notably orange. The Argentine elite who had shunned the tango were now forced into accepting it with national pride.</p>
      
      <p>The tango spread worldwide throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The dance appeared in movies and tango singers traveled the world. By the 1930s, the Golden Age of Argentina was beginning. The country became one of the ten richest nations in the world and music, poetry and culture flourished. The tango came to be a fundamental expression of Argentine culture, and the Golden Age lasted through the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
      
      <p>Tango's fortunes have always been tied to economic conditions and this was very true in the 1950s. During this time, as political repression developed, lyrics reflected political feelings until they started to be banned as subversive. The dance and its music went underground as large dance venues were closed and large gatherings in general were prohibited. The tango survived in smaller, unpublicized venues and in the hearts of the people.</p>
      
      <p>The necessity of going underground combined with the eventual invasion of rock and roll sent the tango into decline until the mid-1980s when the stage show Tango Argentino opened in Paris. Once again Paris was ground zero for igniting tango excitement worldwide. The show toured the world and stimulated a revival in Europe, North America and Japan that we are part of today.</p>

    title: 'Development of tango orchestras',

      <p>Tango began originally as a dance, with sensual choreographies and very simple music. It came from the lowest social classes, and in the beginning it was only danced by men. As the choreography and lyrics started to change, tango began to spread to all the other social classes.</p>

      <p>The first tango orchestras were trios, usually with a harp, flute and violin.  Sometimes a trio might substitute or expand to include other instruments such as a bandoneon, a concertina, a mandolin, or a harmonica. The musicians played intuitively without formal academic training.  Tangos were frequently improvised from very simple tunes.  The players had rudimentary technique, and the lyrics were superficial.</p>

      <p>In time, the guitar (brought to Argentina by the Spanish) replaced the harp and was used to give rhythm to the tango. The dance drew on the "bordoneos" (strummed rhythms) from the guitar, "fiorituras" (flowery embellishments) from the flute, and the "pizzicatos" (staccato plucked notes) from the violin.  With these elements, tango had what was regarded as naughty sound, which invited the dancers to be sensual.</p>

      <p>Among the recorded dance venues were Tambito, El Velódromo, El Kioskito and Lo de Hansen.  The regulars at these venues were the "compadritos" (street ruffians) and members of the porteño (Buenos Aires) aristocracy.</p>

      <p>The piano was long used as a solo instrument in "peringundines" (brothels) and dance houses.  The instrument didn't have a place in early tango trios because its substantial weight made it difficult to move from place to place.</p>

      <p>The piano introduced tango to the highest social classes, but it was Roberto Firpo who introduced the piano into tango orchestras.  A trio formed by Roberto Firpo (piano), Alcides Palavecino (violin) and Juan Carlos  Bazan (clarinet) created a radical change in tango instrumentation when it substituted piano for guitar.  Peforming at El Velódromo and later at El Tambito the trio initiated the era of "piano criollo tangos." Other great pianists of the era include Pancho Nicolini, Camilín, Araujo, Manuel Campoamor, Bevilacqua and Rosendo Mendizábal.</p>

      <p>The early tangos began to be written down, and that encouraged their widespread dissemination.  Among the oldest written tangos are "El Esquinazo," "El Porteñito," "El Choclo," and "Yunta Brava" by  Angel Villoldo; "La Cara de la Luna" by Manuel Campoamor; "Z Club" and "El Entrerriano" by Rosendo Mendizábal; "Unión Cívica" by Santa Cruz; "Don Juan" by Ernesto Ponzio; and "La Morocha" and "Felicia" by Enrique Saborido.</p>

      <p>Over time, the bandoneon (which has become the most characteristic instrument of the tango) supplanted the flute.  For a while, the flute and bandoneon stood side by side, but gradually the flute disappeared.  The change in instrumentation brought another radical change to tango, giving it a more sentimental and less flowery style.  Among the great early bandoneonists were Arturo Berstein, Vicente Greco, Juan Maglio Pacho, Augusto Pedro Berto, Genaro Expósito and Eduardo Arolas.</p>

      <p>Once the bandoneon had replaced the flute and the piano had replaced the guitar, the basis for the orquesta tipica (typical orchestra) was established.  Among the great pianists in these early orquestas tipicas were Agustín Bardi, Enrique Saborido and José Martínez. Many guitarists, such as Domingo Greco, Samuel Castriota, Luciano Ríos and Luis Bertein switched to piano or continued to play both guitar and piano.</p>

      <p>The limited technical skills of the early musicians prevented a meaningful diversity of styles and interpretations.  As the tango and its players advanced, the primitive rhythmic division of 2x4 beat gave way to the more sophisticated 4x8 beat.  Shaped by the bandoneon, the music slowed in tempo and became smoother.  The lyrics began to tell a story.</p>

      <p>The composers—such as Firpo, Carlos Posadas, Arturo De Bassi, Eduardo Arolas, Vicente Greco, Agustín Bardi and Francisco Canaro—began to create tangos more suitable for dancing.  Differences could be found in the compositions, but the playing remained similar.  Differences in style did not appear until years later.</p>
